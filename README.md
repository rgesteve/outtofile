# outtofile

Basically a "prefix" version of the `>` operator in the Unix shell (although it's hard to think of a shell that doesn't support this syntax).  The idea is to use this in task runners like `grunt` or `gulp` or even the VSCode "tasks.json" specification format.  `>` probably works on those, but I was curious to see how this would be written in Golang.
